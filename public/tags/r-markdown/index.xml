AbstractFrom a cultural, social, and even legal viewpoint, getting married is widely considered one of the most significant events in a person’s life. In this analysis, we identify the seasonal and annual trends in the number of marriage licenses that are issued by the City Clerk’s Office of Toronto as published in the “Marriage Licence Statistics” dataset on Toronto’s Open Data Portal. Most notably, thanks to public health policies and (initial) public adherence to those policies, the number of marriage licenses issued in the past few months are significantly lower than usual.</description>
